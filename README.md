c++ implementation of a single player boardgame I design a few years back.
The goal is to achieve a RAD score that is equal to the equalibrium point.
Each turn the various machines in the nuclear power plant will malfunction, either increasing or decreasing the RAD value.
The player has the ability to modify (+1/-1) a machine each turn, or to pass.
